# Relevant Radio App — Watch Tab V9 Prototype Build Tracker

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: AI-GENERATED DOCUMENT — READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**This entire document was generated by Claude based on the watch-tab-v9.jsx prototype, the audience personas (n=11,361 survey), the 7 Video Pain Points document, the content inventory audit (800+ RR+ videos), and extensive design iteration from V7→V8→V9.**

**Rules for using this document:**
- **Peter's live instructions in Claude Code ALWAYS override anything written here.** If Peter says something different in the moment, follow Peter — not this doc.
- **This is a rough guide, not a spec.** Treat each task description as a starting point, not gospel.
- **If anything seems unclear or contradictory, ASK PETER.** Do not assume or guess.
- **Colors, dimensions, layout details, and behaviors described here are approximations** from the V9 prototype — they may change.
- **Do not build ahead or pre-optimize.** Build exactly what Peter asks for in each session, using this doc only as background context.

**In short: This doc = helpful reference. Peter's voice = source of truth.**

## Reference File

**watch-tab-v9.jsx** — The V9 prototype (712 lines). This file lives in the same folder as this tracker. All line numbers reference this file directly.

## Overview

Visual prototype of the Relevant Radio mobile app **Watch Tab**, built one component at a time in Claude Code (React with inline styles). Each task is a discrete, small-scope component that can be built in isolation and assembled into the full Watch Tab.

### V9 Design System — Two Card Types + Universal Badges

V9 consolidated 6 different card formats from V8 down to **two universal card types** and **one badge system** used everywhere:

| Card Type | Width | Used In | Shows |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Episode Card** | 155px | Continue Watching, New This Week, all episode rows, Documentaries | Thumbnail (88px) + badge + progress bar + series label (gray caps) + title (1 line truncated bold) + duration (gray text) |
| **Series Card** | 220px | Featured Series, Fr. Rocky Teaching | Thumbnail (100px) + badge + title (bold) + subtitle ("N episodes") |

**Universal Badge System:**
- Position: top-right of thumbnail, always
- Shape: pill (borderRadius 20)
- Priority: LIVE > UP NEXT > NEW (one badge per card)
- Colors: LIVE = solid red + white text, UP NEXT = solid green + white text, NEW = solid dark green + white text
- CONTINUE badge: only on hero carousel, dark semi-transparent + white text

### Three Pages

1. **Watch Home** — hero carousel, 3-state prayer strip, continue watching, new this week, featured series, episode rows, teaching rows, documentaries
2. **All Series** — full catalog browse with search + 7 category filters (incl. Documentaries)
3. **Series Detail** — hero banner, subscribe, continue watching, episode list

Plus a **Video Player** (4 states) that lives on top of all pages (separate build).

---

## Design Foundation

### Three Personas (from n=11,361 survey)

| Persona | Age | % of Base | Front Door | Key Need |
|---------|-----|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Margaret** (Daily Faithful) | 65–74+ | ~50% | Live prayer / 3-state strip | Zero friction. One tap. Large targets. Clear state changes. |
| **Michael** (Committed Catholic) | 45–64 | ~35% | Continue Watching / named series | Resume playback. Speed control. Binge. New This Week. |
| **Katie** (Seeking Catholic) | 25–44 | ~15% | Featured content / Family Rosary | On-ramp. Video. Kids. Share. |

### Four-Zone Architecture

| Zone | Section | Persona Served |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Zone 1** — Daily Prayer | 3-state prayer strip + hero (live state) | Margaret + committed Katie |
| **Zone 2** — Featured | Hero carousel (editorial) + Featured Series row | Returning Katie + Michael discovery |
| **Zone 3** — Continue Watching | Continue Watching row + New This Week | Michael (his #1 need) |
| **Zone 4** — Series Depth | Episode rows, Fr. Rocky Teaching, All Series, Series Detail | Michael + Katie depth |

### Design Tokens (Lines 44–56)

newBadge: "#1A6B3A"    newBadgeSoft: "rgba(26,107,58,0.08)"
```

### Pain Points Addressed Per Component

Each task below notes which of the 7 pain points it addresses:
- **PP#1** "I don't know you have video" — surface video immediately
- **PP#2** "The prayer I want is audio-only" — video prayer integration
- **PP#3** "I can't share what moved me" — share buttons, shareable clips
- **PP#4** "I can't find what I'm looking for" — search, curation, progress tracking
- **PP#5** "I can't see the people I listen to" — host faces, show clips
- **PP#6** "My phone is too small / can't figure this out" — large targets, simplicity
- **PP#7** "There's nothing for my kids" — family prayer, kid-friendly content

---

## V9 Reusable Primitives (Lines 163–255)

Unlike V7/V8, V9 has **explicit shared components** that are used across the entire prototype. These ARE built as reusable components:

| Component | Lines | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Badge** | 177–185 | Pill badge top-right of any thumbnail. 3 types: live, upnext, new. |
| **DurationStamp** | 189–195 | DEPRECATED on cards — still used in Series Detail episode list thumbnails. |
| **ProgressBar** | 199–205 | Gold bar at bottom edge of thumbnail. |
| **EpisodeCard** | 210–228 | 155px episode card — thumbnail + badge + progress bar + 3 text lines. |
| **SeriesCard** | 230–241 | 220px series card — thumbnail + badge + title + subtitle. |
| **SectionHeader** | 247–252 | Bold section title with optional right-aligned link. |
| **ScrollRow** | 254–256 | Horizontal scroll container. |

### TASK 3 — Hero Billboard / Carousel
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** 3rd (first thing user sees below header)
**Pain Points:** PP#1 (surface video), PP#2 (live prayer visible), PP#4 (resume)
**Persona:** All three — the single most important real estate on the Watch Tab

**What it is:**
A large featured card with TWO modes:
1. **Live mode** — when a prayer is streaming, hero becomes a red-tinted live card with LIVE badge top-right (pill-shaped)
2. **Carousel mode** — when nothing live, shows 4 swipeable editorial slides

**V9 Design Decisions (different from V7):**
- **No slide counter** (1/3 removed — unnecessary chrome)
- **No "Featured" badge** — being in the hero IS the feature
- **CONTINUE pill** on resume slides: top-right of thumbnail, dark semi-transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0.55)), white text, pill-shaped. Only appears on slides with isContinue: true.
- **LIVE badge on hero: top-right** (same position as all other badges — consistent placement)
- **No percentage text** (e.g., "65% watched") — progress bar alone communicates position
- **First slide is Lenten Lessons on the Mass** (timely editorial choice for Lent 2026)

**Requirements — Live Mode:**
- Full-width card, borderRadius 16, liveBg background, red-tinted border
- Image area: 170px tall, gradient background, centered 56px round PLAY button (red bg, white icon)
- LIVE pill badge: top-right, red bg, pulsing white dot + "LIVE" text, borderRadius 20
- Below image: prayer name in Georgia serif (20px, 800 weight) + detail text in red
- Tappable → navigates to series detail

**Requirements — Carousel Mode (4 slides):**
- Same card structure (170px image area + text below)
- Slide data (Lines 262–267):
  - **Slide 1:** "Lenten Lessons on the Mass" — Fr. Rocky · 40 episodes (no continue pill)
  - **Slide 2:** "SEEK 2026" — 24 talks · Watch the full series (no continue pill)
  - **Slide 3:** "Life Is Worth Living" — Fulton Sheen · Ep. 4 of 12 (CONTINUE pill + 65% progress bar)
  - **Slide 4:** "Into the Breach" — Knights of Columbus · Ep. 2 of 8 (CONTINUE pill + 38% progress bar)
- Continue slides: darker play button, gold progress bar, CONTINUE pill top-right
- Non-continue slides: ghost play button, no pill, no progress bar
- Pagination dots below card: active = gold 18px wide, inactive = text4 6px circle
- Tappable dots + tappable card

**Reference:** Lines 262–313 of watch-tab-v9.jsx

### TASK 4 — Live Daily Prayer Cards (3-State Strip)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** 4th
**Pain Points:** PP#2 (video prayer integration), PP#6 (one-tap access, clear state feedback)
**Persona:** Margaret (primary), Katie (family prayer)

**What it is:**
Three side-by-side prayer cards ordered chronologically through the day: Mass (12 PM), Chaplet (3 PM), Rosary (7 PM). Each card has a gradient thumbnail, prayer name + time, and a **3-state strip** below that handles all reminder/live interaction.

**V9 Design Decisions (different from V7/V8):**
- **No bell icon on thumbnail** — the strip owns ALL reminder state
- **3-state strip** replaces the old bell toggle + "Remind me" disappearing strip
- **Three distinct colors** for Margaret's visibility:
  - State 1 "Remind me" — gold background, dashed top border, outline bell icon, gold text
  - State 2 "Reminder set" — **light green** background, solid border, filled bell icon, green text
  - State 3 "Watch now" — **solid red** background, pulsing white dot, white text
- **Order is chronological:** Mass → Chaplet → Rosary (left to right follows the day)
- Tapping the strip toggles between State 1 ↔ State 2
- State 3 activates automatically when that prayer is LIVE (driven by time simulator)

**Requirements:**
- Section header: "Live Daily Prayer" (14px, 800 weight) + subtitle "Pray live with your Catholic family" (11px, text3)
- 3 cards in a row, each flex: 1 (equal width), 8px gap
- Each card structure:
  - **Photo area:** 72px tall, gradient background, host initials centered as faint serif text
  - **No badge or bell on thumbnail** — clean gradient only
  - **Info area:** prayer short name in Georgia serif (12px, 700) left, time or "● Now" right
  - Card always has top-rounded corners (12px 12px 0 0) — strip is always visible below
- **Strip below card** (always present, one of 3 states):
  - Rounded bottom corners (0 0 12px 12px) to complete the card shape
  - Bell icon (10px) + label text (8px, 700 weight)
  - Tappable — toggles reminder state

**State logic:**
- Uses simulated time (or real time) to determine live/upcoming/past
- Mass: 12:00–12:45 PM
- Chaplet: 3:00–3:20 PM
- Rosary: 7:00–7:25 PM
- stripState = isLive ? "live" : reminderSet ? "set" : "unset"

**Data (Lines 89–93):**
```
Mass:    { time: "12:00 PM", gradient: "#7A6B52 → #3D3528", initials: "FR" }
Chaplet: { time: "3:00 PM",  gradient: "#4F6275 → #253A4D", initials: "DM" }
Rosary:  { time: "7:00 PM",  gradient: "#5B6B4F → #2A3B22", initials: "FR" }
```

**Reference:** Lines 316–370 of watch-tab-v9.jsx

**Persona:** Michael (primary)

**What it is:**
Horizontal scroll row of in-progress episodes using the universal **EpisodeCard** component.

**V9 Design Decisions:**
- Uses EpisodeCard (155px) — same card as everywhere else

**What it is:**
Horizontal scroll of the latest episode from each active series, using the universal **EpisodeCard** with NEW badges.

**V9 Design Decisions:**
- Same EpisodeCard as Continue Watching — NO bespoke formatting

- NEW badge (pill, solid dark green, white text) on each card
- Section header shows count: "New This Week" + "4 new" pill

**Requirements:**

- 4 Episode Cards:

Wider landscape cards showcasing editorially curated series using the universal **SeriesCard** component.

- Lenten Series 2026 gets NEW badge (timely seasonal content)

Horizontal scroll of documentary films using **EpisodeCard** — same card as everything else. The runtime format ("1h 38m") makes it obvious these are films without needing a special card type.

## V9 Key Design Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 6 card formats → 2 (EpisodeCard + SeriesCard) | Consistency. One mental model for users. Easier to build. |
| Duration moved from thumbnail overlay to 3rd text line | Cleaner thumbnails. Duration is metadata, not visual content. |
| No duration on Series Cards | Series are collections — no single duration to show. Episode count communicates scope. |
| Pill-shaped badges (borderRadius 20) | More modern, more visible, consistent shape language everywhere. |
| High-contrast badges (solid bg, white text) | Margaret's eyesight. Must be readable at arm's length. |
| 3-state prayer strip (gold → green → red) | Clear feedback for Margaret. Each state is unmistakable. Bell icon removed from thumbnail. |
| Prayer order: Mass → Chaplet → Rosary | Chronological through the day. Natural reading order. |
| CONTINUE pill on hero (not "Featured" badge) | Being in the hero IS featured. Only resume slides need a label. |
| No slide counter on hero | Unnecessary chrome. Pagination dots are sufficient. |
| No percentage text on hero | Progress bar alone communicates position. Cleaner. |
| No dates on New This Week cards | Same card as everything else. NEW badge + section context is enough. |
| Series Card subtitles: just "N episodes" | Unified language. No genre descriptors. Clean. |
| Fr. Rocky Teaching: Series Cards in scroll (not grid) | Same card type as Featured Series. Consistency over novelty. |
| Documentaries: Episode Cards (not special wider cards) | Runtime format "1h 38m" communicates film length. No special card needed. |
| First hero slide: Lenten Lessons on the Mass | Timely editorial choice for Lent 2026 season. |
