| `ea06c13` | Added Charity Mobile sponsor banner (Task 3) — home screen only, fixed position between Now Playing bar and bottom nav |
| `658a3a9` | Fixed sponsor banner clipping — increased Now Playing bar offset from 116 to 128 |

### Summary
Built two home screen components from the todo tracker. **Task 3** replaced the wireframe ad placeholder with the actual Charity Mobile sponsor banner image, positioned as a fixed element above the bottom nav and only visible on the Home tab. **Task 4** added a rotating promotional banner carousel at the top of the home screen with 4 banner images (Lent 40, Eucharistic Encounters, Holy Land Pilgrimage, Lenten Lessons), swipeable left/right with auto-rotation every 5 seconds. Iterated on both — fixed banner clipping on Task 3, then stripped the rainbow bar and dots from the carousel per Peter's feedback to keep it clean and swipe-only.
