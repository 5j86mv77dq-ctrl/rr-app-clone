# Relevant Radio App — Home Screen Prototype Build Tracker

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: AI-GENERATED DOCUMENT — READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**This entire document was generated by Claude based on Peter's voice transcript and screenshots of the Relevant Radio app. Peter has NOT explicitly verified every detail, requirement, or description in this file.**

**Rules for using this document:**
- **Peter's live instructions in Claude Code ALWAYS override anything written here.** If Peter says something different in the moment, follow Peter — not this doc.
- **This is a rough guide, not a spec.** Treat each task description as a starting point, not gospel.
- **If anything seems unclear or contradictory, ASK PETER.** Do not assume or guess.
- **Colors, dimensions, layout details, and behaviors described here are approximations** from screenshots and a casual voice walkthrough — they may be wrong.
- **Do not build ahead or pre-optimize.** Build exactly what Peter asks for in each session, using this doc only as background context.

**In short: This doc = helpful reference. Peter's voice = source of truth.**

## Overview
Visual prototype of the Relevant Radio mobile app home screen, built one component at a time in Claude Code (React with inline styles). Each task is a discrete, small-scope component that can be built in isolation and assembled into the full home screen.


## Recurring Patterns (Reference Only)
These patterns appear across multiple tasks. **Do NOT build these as standalone reusable components up front.** Build them inline as part of each individual task. If reuse opportunities emerge naturally, refactor later.

- **Horizontal Scroll Row** — appears in Tasks 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (with different card shapes/overlays each time)
- **Full-Width Hero Card with Overlay Text** — appears in Tasks 4, 6
- **Persistent Bar** — appears in Tasks 2, 3, 7
